                    The majority of the Class of 2024 reported being liberal throughout their time at Vanderbilt, though more students became liberal by graduation. Most also reported voting in their home state or country, and 79% participated in a political activity either on campus or in Nashville during their time at Vanderbilt.

                    “On campus, I participated in a few protests for administration to divest from fossil fuel companies, as well as one to support further availability of accessible and gender neutral restrooms in lecture halls which remain largely inaccessible to many students,” Ava Kovalski (‘24) said. “I think that these demonstrations were important to help raise awareness, but later on in my time at Vanderbilt, I felt that my time was better spent at off-campus demonstrations. I grew to be a bit cynical about the level of interest that administrators had with openly communicating with concerned students.”

                    When it comes to the ongoing <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/tag/israel-hamas-war/">Israel-Hamas war</a>, 48% of seniors stated they were pro-Palestine, while 16% said they were pro-Israel and 21% are undecided.

                    Most students strongly disagree with the university's approach to responding to the issue. Chancellor Daniel Diemerier has <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/12/09/debrief-with-diermeier-balancing-free-speech-and-commitment-to-student-safety/">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/30/debrief-with-diermeier-chancellor-draws-line-on-principled-neutrality/">committed</a> to a policy of “institutional neutrality” regarding political issues, including the war. The administration <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/04/06/three-students-expelled-following-student-accountability-hearings-faculty-criticize-university-response/">expelled</a> three students, suspended one and issued disciplinary probation to 22 after a <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/26/breaking-divest-coalition-protesters-sit-in-at-kirkland-hall-at-least-seven-suspended/">sit-in</a> at Kirkland Hall in support of a <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/03/petition-calling-for-vsg-to-divest-from-pro-israel-organizations-gains-over-600-signatures/">VSG referendum</a> that would cause the organization to boycott BDS target corporations.

                    Kovalski voiced her support for Palestine and expressed skepticism about the U.S. government's stance due to its relationship with Israel. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    “I support the Palestinian people and continue to hope for a ceasefire,” Kovalski said. “I am not hopeful that the American government will support a ceasefire due to its entanglements with the Israeli government, but it is important for Americans and people around the world to keep vocalizing support for Palestine.”

                    Ari Enav (‘24) offered insights into how his personal background of being born in Israel and raised by an Israeli mother shaped his ongoing pro-Israel views. Enav also spent about two years living in Israel and explained that his extended family lives there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “[Israel] is a place where I truly feel is home for me…It really feels like it’s a part of me, almost inseparable from my identity, so that’s definitely the main thing that forms my perspective, but it’s a perspective that I’ve challenged, especially during times like these,” Enav said. “In terms of the ongoing conflict, I definitely hope that we see an end soon. That's been my hope for a very long time to have peace in Israel, to have peace with our neighbors and ultimately find a path to coexistence that is built on mutual respect and a foundation of trust, so I really hope that’s something we’ll see in our lifetime.”

                    Outgoing VSG president Samuel Sliman (‘24) reflected on his experience participating in a Vanderbilt Hillel trip to Israel and Palestine designed to offer educational insights into the conflict.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Immediately after being chosen as VSG president, I participated in a trip organized by Vanderbilt Hillel to Israel and Palestine intended to educate students about the conflict,” Sliman said. “While I approached the experience with an open mind, the trip felt more like an exercise in Israeli propaganda. I learned from people on the ground, and my initial beliefs were strongly reinforced. It's clear to me that, in any conflict, the privileged tend to benefit further, while the oppressed remain trapped in their struggle.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    During Sliman’s term, the VSG Senate passed <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/04/20/vsg-passes-two-resolutions-condemning-university-response-to-kirkland-protests/">two resolutions</a> condemning the university’s response to Kirkland protests.

                    The most popular political position of those featured on the survey was divesting from fossil fuels, which 66% of students supported. A majority of seniors also supported stricter gun control, abortion, and making gender-affirming care available to minors. The least popular political position was that Greek life should be abolished, which 33% of students supported. In the Class of 2023, 44% of students believed that Greek life should be abolished, signaling waning support for this position.

                    Shreya Gupta ('24), who served as the Diversity and Inclusion Committee Chair of VSG, criticized the political environment in Tennessee. Throughout the Class of 2024’s time at Vanderbilt, the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/10/vanderbilt-creates-task-force-on-tennessee-laws-restricting-gender-affirming-care-for-minors-and-drag-shows-community-reacts/">Tennessee government</a> banned gender-affirming care for minors and restricted drag performances, and Vanderbilt formed a task force in response. Gupta emphasized the need for campus administration to address these issues by actively listening to transgender students and investing in meaningful support measures. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "There is a horrible and oppressive political climate in Tennessee, highlighted by the scandals at VUMC and the way Nashville citizens have been able to harass students on campus with signs that de-legitimize their existence,” Gupta said. “I think no administrator wants campus to be unsafe, but there seems to be a disconnect. Campus administration could really benefit from listening to trans students specifically and finding out how to best support them by putting their money where their mouth is.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gupta added that Vanderbilt's administration needs to take more concrete steps to ensure the safety and protection of their students. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “While it's great that the KC Potter Center has tons of resources, the university can't just place the responsibility of protecting all diverse sexual orientations on one small space on campus,” Gupta said. “They need to fully support their students and clearly say, 'We support our students, and we reject what's happening in our state.' It's about standing up for our students' right to exist."
